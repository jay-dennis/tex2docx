### tex2docx

This repository has a collection of code that I've written to convert latex (.tex) to MS Word (.docx).
Many people need latex to do their jobs efficiently; I am one of those people.
Unfortunately, not all organizations have latex support, and many have requirements for producing documents in MS Word (.docx) format.
Pandoc can be used to convert .tex to .docx; however, there are some issues with the associated workflow.
While pandoc filters are currently being developed to address some of these issues, all of them have not been addressed yet, so I created this workflow to work around these issue while still using pandoc as the underlying conversion mechanism.
